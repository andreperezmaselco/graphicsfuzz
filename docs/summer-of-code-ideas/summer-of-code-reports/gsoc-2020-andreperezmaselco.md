## Abstract

During the *Google Summer of Code 2020* program, I worked on the development of new semantics-preserving transformations, fuzzer passes and enhancements for the *spirv-fuzz* tool.
Also, I developed [Amber Fuzz](https://github.com/andreperezmaselco/amber-fuzz), a simple graphics tool that takes an [Amber](https://github.com/google/amber) script as input and outputs a new script by fuzzing the reference shaders.

## Introduction
Graphics shaders are programs to run on a Graphics Processing Unit. Shaders can be written using the *OpenGL Shading Language* or *SPIR-V* (a simple binary intermediate language). Since shaders are programs, they need to be compiled into specific GPU instructions. A question that arises is what if the shader compiler has bugs? Some tools have been developed to deal with this problem.

[SPIRV-Tools](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools) is a collection of tools to work on *SPIR-V* modules.
One of these tools is *spirv-fuzz*. It applies semantics-preserving transformations to a *SPIR-V* module. Theoretically, a semantics-preserving sentence should not change the behaviour of the variant code. If it has changed, then an error has occurred halfway, probably a compiler bug. In this way, the reference and variant shaders can be compared to check the differences. This approach, known as fuzzing, is part of technique called metamorphic testing. 

The following is an example of transformation that replaces an `OpVectorTimesScalar` instruction with its mathematical definition. The vector components are extracted and multiplied by the scalar. Finally, the new vector is constructed using the multiplied components.

This project was concerned to use the metamorphic testing approach to extend *spirv-fuzz* by adding new transformations to cover features of *SPIR-V* that are not yet very widely-used, but that will be in the future.
Also, the project used tools such as [CLSmith](https://github.com/ChrisLidbury/CLSmith) and [clspv](https://github.com/google/clspv) to improve *spirv-fuzz*.

## Development

Transformations and fuzzer passes work together to modify the shader source code.
The fuzzer pass iterates over the *SPIR-V* module and decides whether a transformation will be applied.
Below are the transformations, fuzzer passes and improvements developed during the program.
